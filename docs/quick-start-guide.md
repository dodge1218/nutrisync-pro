## 🚀 Getting Started (First 5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Log Your First Meal

1. Click **"Log Food"** in the navigation
2. Use **Quick Add** buttons for common foods (eggs, yogurt, chicken, etc.)
3. Or **Search** for specific foods (e.g., "lentils", "salmon", "kefir")
4. Select a food, enter servings (e.g., "1" or "0.5"), and click **"Add to Log"**

**Tip:** Start by logging your typical breakfast. You can add more meals throughout the day.

---

### Step 2: View Your Analysis

1. Click **"Dashboard"** in the navigation
2. See your:
   - **Calories** and **Macros** (protein, carbs, fat)
   - **Gut Support Score (0-100)** — higher is better
   - **GBDI (Gut-Brain-Digestive Index)** — overall gut health
   - **Adrenal Load** — stress markers (lower is better)
   - **Top 3 Fixes** — highest-impact improvements

3. Scroll down to see:
   - **Key Nutrients** — color-coded % of Daily Value bars
   - **Wellness Audit** — fermented foods, plant diversity, mineral balance
   - **Staple Compliance** — liver, cultured dairy, pumpkin seeds tracking

---

### Step 3: Check Your Insights

1. Click **"Insights"** (Recommendations) in the navigation
2. Review:
   - **Synergy Suggestions** — food pairings to optimize absorption
   - **Timing Conflicts** — e.g., "coffee near iron-rich meal"
   - **Critical Gaps** — nutrients where you're significantly low
   - **Product Suggestions** (optional) — supplements to close gaps

**Example Insight:**
> "You consumed plant-based iron (lentils) but no vitamin C. Adding vitamin C can triple non-heme iron absorption. **Warm option:** Add cooked bell peppers, tomatoes, or broccoli to your iron-rich meal."

---

### Step 4: Learn the Science

1. Click **"Learn"** (Education) in the navigation
2. Browse educational cards covering:
   - **Synergies:** Vitamin C + Iron, Fat-Soluble Vitamins + Healthy Fats
   - **Timing:** Coffee & Iron conflict, Meal timing for sleep
   - **Nutrients:** Magnesium for stress, Vitamin D importance
   - **Gut Health:** Fermented foods, Fiber for microbiome

Each card includes:
- Clear explanation
- **Key Takeaway** (TL;DR)

## 🍽️ Tips for Effective Tracking

### 1. **Log Consistently** (at least 3 days)
One day isn't enough to see patterns. Track for 3-7 days to get accurate insights.

### 2. **Be Honest About Portions**
The analysis is only as good as your input. Use the serving sizes shown (e.g., "1 cup", "6 oz").

### 3. **Include Variety**
Don't eat the same 3 foods every day. Plant diversity boosts gut health (aim for 30+ different plants per week).

### 4. **Log Fermented Foods**
Track kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi — they're gut health MVPs. Aim for 2+ servings per week.

### 5. **Check Timing Conflicts**
If you see a coffee-iron conflict alert, adjust your timing. Space coffee 2+ hours from iron-rich meals.

- Penalties for ultra-processed foods and gut stressors

**Good score:** 70+  
**Great score:** 85+  

**How to improve:**
- Add 1-2 fermented foods (kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut)
- Increase fiber (lentils, oats, vegetables)
- Eat diverse plants (aim for 5-7 different plant foods daily)

---

#### GBDI (Gut-Brain-Digestive Index) (0-100)
**What it measures:**
- Overall gut health (fiber, fermented foods, plant diversity)
- Digestive wellness (warm food ratio, gut stressors)
- Nutrient support for gut lining (magnesium)

**Good score:** 65+  
**Great score:** 80+  

**How to improve:**
- All the above (Gut Support Score)
- Prioritize warm, cooked foods (easier to digest)
- Ensure adequate magnesium (pumpkin seeds, spinach)

---

#### Adrenal Load (0-100)
**What it measures:**
- Stress markers: caffeine, refined sugar, ultra-processed foods
- Nutrient deficiencies that worsen stress response (magnesium, vitamin C)

**Good score:** <40  
**Moderate stress:** 40-60  
**High stress:** 60+  

**How to reduce:**
- Limit coffee (especially in afternoon)
- Reduce ultra-processed foods
- Increase magnesium-rich foods
- Boost vitamin C (bell peppers, broccoli, citrus)

## 🧠 Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. **Nutrient Synergies** (Make absorption better)
- **Vitamin C + Iron** — Vitamin C triples non-heme iron absorption
- **Healthy Fats + Fat-Soluble Vitamins (A, D, E, K)** — Need fat to absorb
- **Vitamin D + Calcium** — Work together for bone health

### 2. **Nutrient Antagonisms** (Block absorption)
- **Coffee/Tea + Iron** — Tannins block iron (space 2+ hours apart)
- **High Calcium + Iron** — Calcium reduces iron absorption (separate meals)
- **Phytates (grains/legumes) + Minerals** — Reduced absorption (cooking helps)

### 3. **Timing Matters**
- **Protein Distribution** — Better to eat 30g protein at 3 meals than 90g at one
- **Iron + Vitamin C** — Consume in the same meal for synergy
- **Heavy Meals Late** — Can disrupt sleep (finish eating by 7-8pm)

### 4. **Gut Health Triad**
1. **Fiber** (feed beneficial bacteria) — 25-35g daily
2. **Fermented Foods** (add beneficial bacteria) — 2+ servings weekly
3. **Plant Diversity** (varied nutrients for microbiome) — 30+ plants weekly

## 🎓 Common Questions

### Q: How accurate are the nutrient values?
**A:** Nutrient values are estimates based on USDA averages. Actual values vary by:
- Farming methods (organic vs. conventional)
- Freshness and storage
- Cooking methods
- Brand differences

**Always add disclaimer:** "Nutrient values are approximate. Consult a professional for medical-grade accuracy."

---

### Q: Should I take the supplements suggested?
**A:** **Food first, always.** Supplements are optional and should be:
- Discussed with your doctor or dietitian
- Used only for significant gaps (>30% below DV)
- From high-quality brands (third-party tested)

The app always prioritizes whole food solutions over supplements.

---

### Q: What if I can't find my food in the database?
**A:** Currently, the database has 20 common foods. In future versions:
- We'll expand to 100+ foods
- Integrate USDA FoodData Central API (10,000+ foods)
- Allow custom food entry

For now, search for the closest match (e.g., "chicken breast" for most chicken dishes).

---

### Q: Why prioritize "warm foods"?
**A:** Warm, cooked foods are:
- Easier to digest (less work for your gut)
- Better for those with IBS, bloating, or "weak digestion"
- Aligned with traditional medicine principles (Ayurveda, TCM)

Cold/raw foods are fine if you tolerate them well! This is a preference, not a rule.

---

### Q: What's the deal with liver?
**A:** Liver is the most nutrient-dense food on the planet:
- **Vitamin B12:** 3000% DV per 3 oz
- **Vitamin A:** 700% DV
- **Iron:** 30% DV (heme iron, highly absorbable)
- **Copper, folate, riboflavin:** Off the charts

**Target:** 2-3x per week (small servings, e.g., 2-3 oz). Can be:
- Beef liver (most common)
- Chicken liver (milder)
- Liver pâté (easy to eat)

If you dislike it, supplements like "desiccated liver capsules" are an option.

---

### Q: Can I use this app if I'm vegan/vegetarian?
**A:** Yes! The app includes:
- Plant-based proteins (lentils, quinoa, tofu — future)
- Non-heme iron tracking + vitamin C synergy alerts
- Fermented plant foods (sauerkraut, kimchi)

**Note:** Pay extra attention to:
- **Iron** (pair with vitamin C)
- **Vitamin B12** (supplement or fortified foods)
- **Omega-3** (flax, chia, algae oil)
- **Zinc** (pumpkin seeds, legumes)

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "No meals logged yet today"
→ Go to **Log Food** and add at least one meal

### "I logged food but don't see analysis"
→ Make sure the food was logged **today** (check timestamp)  
→ Refresh the page

### "Analysis seems wrong"
→ Double-check serving quantities (e.g., 1 cup vs. 2 cups)  
→ Ensure you selected the correct food

### "I want to reset my data"
→ Open DevTools (F12) → Application → Storage → spark.kv → Delete "food-logs"
