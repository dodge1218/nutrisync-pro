## Deployment Recommendation

### ✅ APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

The application is **100% ready** for immediate production deployment. All MVP features defined in the PRD are complete, tested, and working. The codebase is clean, documented, and maintainable.

### Recommended Next Steps After Deployment:

1. **Monitor user engagement** - Track which features are most used
2. **Gather feedback** - Learn what users find valuable vs. confusing
3. **Iterate based on real needs** - Build Phase 7k/7j/8 only if users request them
4. **Track metrics** - Daily active users, meal logging frequency, mode preferences
5. **Refine AI insights** - Tune prompts based on user ratings

### Do NOT Build Until Users Request:
- Personalized profiles (Phase 7k)
- Exercise tracking (Phase 7j)
- User authentication (Phase 8)
- Auto-task generation (Phase 8c)

**Ship it. Learn. Iterate.**
